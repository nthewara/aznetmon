## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24 or higher
- Docker (for container testing)
- Git

### Dependencies
- github.com/gorilla/websocket v1.5.3
- golang.org/x/net v0.40.0
- Development tools:
  - github.com/air-verse/air (live reload)
  - github.com/cosmos/gosec/v2 (security scanner)

### Development Environment

#### Option 1: Using Dev Container (Recommended)
The easiest way to get started is using Visual Studio Code with the Dev Container extension.

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nthewara/aznetmon.git
   cd aznetmon
   ```
4. Open the project in VS Code:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
5. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or run the "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" command from the Command Palette (F1)
6. VS Code will build the dev container and open the project inside it with all required tools pre-installed

The Dev Container includes:
- Go 1.24 with all required tools
- Air for hot reloading
- All necessary permissions for ICMP monitoring
- Debugging support

#### Option 2: Local Setup
If you prefer to develop without using a Dev Container:

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/nthewara/aznetmon.git
cd aznetmon

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Install development tools
make install-dev-tools

# Run tests
make test

# Run locally
make run

# Run with hot reload
make dev
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Test Docker build
make docker-build

# Test deployment script
./deploy.sh "8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1"
```

## Code Style

### Go Code
- Follow standard Go formatting (`go fmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for public functions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Handle errors appropriately

### Commit Messages
Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` formatting changes
- `refactor:` code refactoring
- `test:` adding tests
- `chore:` maintenance tasks

### Example:
```
feat: add support for IPv6 ping monitoring

- Add IPv6 address resolution
- Update UI to display IPv6 addresses
- Add tests for IPv6 functionality

Closes #123
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Workflow Failure Reporting

AzNetMon uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. To improve the development experience:

- Workflow failures automatically create GitHub issues
- Issues include detailed information about the failure, including:
  - Which jobs and steps failed
  - Timing information
  - Links to the full logs
- This helps track and resolve CI/CD issues more efficiently

If you receive an automatic issue about workflow failures:
1. Check the failure details provided in the issue
2. Fix the issue in your branch
3. Push your changes
4. If the issue is resolved, close the automatically created issue
